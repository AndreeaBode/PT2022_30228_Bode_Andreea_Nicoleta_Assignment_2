The objective of this project is to simulate an application in which the user enters the number of customers and queues, the minimum arrival time, the maximum arrival time, the minimum service time, the maximum service time. A series of customers is simulated, randomly generated at a certain time interval, at which the time they arrived at the house and the service time are set. Each customer will always be added to the most optimal queue, i.e. the one that has the shortest waiting time. Each customer will be added to the queue when the arrival time is equal to the simulation time. As the simulation time increases, the serving time decreases, when it reaches 1, the customer is removed from the queue. This project is based on threads.
